        "If you don't have a BBQ you can also do the wings in the oven at 200C for about 45-50 minutes. Place them in a tray to catch all the drippings. I like to scrape the good bits and fat at the end. You can save it too for something else to add a major flavour boost.",
        "Personally I think these are the greatest on a BBQ. If using a gas Weber (what I use) then the hood should read about 150C and normally the burners are on low. We use the grill, not the flat-top."
