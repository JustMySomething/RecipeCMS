        "For pickling you don't need to go out buying jars or fancy ingredients. You can, as I do, get away with using jars from other things like olives, capers, other pickles, etc etc.",
        "You need to make sure you sterilize your jars. The easiest way I find, which is in the recipes, is to bring a large pot to a simmer with the jars fully submergered. Then I pull them out with tongs and immediately fill.",
        "Pickling is mainly just submerging something in a water, vinegar and salt mixture. You can pickle all sorts of random things but more importantly, you can add so many different flavours! Take a look at the dill pickle recipe for an example of all the different things I like to add."
