        "The romesco sauce is great to have with meat juices added in from whatever meat you're having it with. For example, if having with pork belly, after it's cooked then add in a blend through some of the tray juices. It adds so much great flavour.",
        "It is really important that you blend the romesco sauce really well so that it's smooth. To get the smoothest sauce make sure you remove any seeds, any tomato/capsicum skin, and use almond butter rather than trying to blend your own almods. Or, if you make your own almond butter, make sure you blend that well too."
