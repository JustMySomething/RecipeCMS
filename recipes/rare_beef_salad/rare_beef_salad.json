      "Also great with carrot or capsicums mixed through salad. Super flexible.",
      "Using a heavy pan, like a cast iron, is important for getting a good sear. Without it you'll likely struggle to get a good sear without a powerful stovetop, like a good induction cooktop.",
      "Dressing is better with fresh lime juice and garlic rather than from a jar/bottle. Also good with a bit of ginger in it and sesame oil instead of veg.",
