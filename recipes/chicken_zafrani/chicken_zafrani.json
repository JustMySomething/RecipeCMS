    "description": "Chicken Zafrani is a rich and aromatic Indian main course featuring tender chicken thighs marinated in a flavorful blend of Greek yoghurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, almond and cashew butters, and a medley of traditional spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. The chicken is then simmered with whole spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and star anise in ghee, and finished with a touch of heavy cream for a luscious, creamy texture. Perfect served over rice.",
