  "notes": [
      "Amazingly simple, really great with rice or just with the potatoes. Also like it with broccolini baked with it.",
      "Best curry paste to use is Maesri but others will do if you don't have a choice.",
      "No need to change the quantities if increasing or decreasing the amount of meat. You'll end up with glorious amounts of gravy regardless.",
