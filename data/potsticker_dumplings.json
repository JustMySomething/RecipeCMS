Add the dumplings flat side down around the edge of the pan to ensure they cook evenly. Fry them until a golden crust forms on the bottom, normally takes about 2 minutes. Do not let it cook too long or it will ruin them. Add about 150ml of water to the pan and cover. Cook for about 10 minutes or until almost all the water has evaporated. Continue cooking uncovered until the dumplings regain their crispy base. Don't forget, while cooking this batch continue folding more so that there are always dumplings ready for the pan.", "name": "Fry", "url": 4}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Continue wrapping and cooking until they're all done!", "name": "Wrap, Fry, Repeat", "url": 5}], "notes": ["My family and I like to cook and eat these at the same time rather than preparing a big batch to eat at the table.

We have done these with spring onions, carrots and capsicum before (not all in the same filling).", "The pork mince we use is only 5-10% fat which is why we use so much sesame oil. If you find fattier mince you can use less sesame oil (or more if you're into that).", "Easiest cooked in a non-stick pan.
